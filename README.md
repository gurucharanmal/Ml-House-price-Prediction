## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices accurately. The model is built using a dataset of historical house prices and various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `dataset` directory. It includes the following files:
- `fetch_california_housing_data.csv`: The dataset of model, you can split dataset acroding to your model 
- `road_and_county.csv`:  that file contain dataset of road and county
